I never was able to wear glowy foundations or put highlight on my cheekbones and bridge of my nose because I too afraid to draw attention to it. The texture of my nose was especially noticeable like uneven dark Braille and so deep I couldn\\'t even extract them.I know you\\'re not supposed to pick but I\\'d be so desperate just for smooth skin I\\'d accept the redness and broken skin it\\'d leave me with if I could lessen the amount of bumps. I thought a strong face wash would solve my problem and sometimes glycolic based products would help but just temporarily and salicylic acid just helped acne the clogged pores caused but salicylic didn\\'t unclog my congested skin. I don\\'t like scrubs daily even though those helped turn my skin over more than just washes, I needed something stronger in a different way. This is the only product I have ever rated five stars it has turned over my skin has gotten all the dead skin makeup dirt out of my pores and my skin is the clearest it\\'s EVER been thanks to this product the dark dots are gone my skin is smooth. I saw instant results from the first over night use and after prolonged use I was able to go from a whole over night layer daily use to just spot treatments when I thought I needed it. I was also able to buy a gentle face wash because this did all the work for me that was nice. I know this is mainly ment for anti aging but this has changed my life my skin is so smooth also my pores are way smaller I\\'m no longer afraid to be seen bare face or wear highlight. It\\'s never irritated my skin I can build it up onto spots that are alil more stubborn without redness or dryness. The smell is a little offputting it smells like floral baby powder. I thought that was going to irritate and break me out when I first used this product because I\\'m normally sensitive to scents but it faded once it dried and didn\\'t affect me at all. I ran out a few days ago and I can already see my skin reverting back to its old ways so I need to go buy more the packaging is heavy so don\\'t let that fool you into thinking you have a lot left. turn the bottle upside down to get a feeling for how much is left the bottle has a white color paper surrounding the yellow cream inside so if u turn it upside down you\\'ll see the inside mechanism move upwards as you run out.

Retinol is known for this but is also known for being a very effective anti aging ingredient. It takes awhile to see results but it can really help resurface your skin. You have to use a sunscreen during the day because both the alpha hydroxy peels and retinol pads make you much more sensitive to sun damage.

The same ingredients my dermatologists have recommended and have shown results in many studies. Just get a nice gentle moisturizer for after.

YES!!!', 'text': [u'When SK-II graciously offered to send me a complimentary bottle of their Facial Treatment Oil in exchange for my honest review, I have to admit, I was a little concerned. I have combination skin, and I thought that adding oil to my already oily areas would lead to massive breakouts. Before I accepted SK-II\\'s offer, I did a little research. I\\'m so glad I did!', u'I learned that adding high quality oils to your face, not only hydrates the dry skin areas, but it also controls the natural production of sebum (the nasty, natural oil that your face produces) by tricking your face into thinking it has already produced the sebum that the skin needs. The difference is, adding oil to your face actually PREVENTS your face from producing too much sebum. This was mind blowing to me!! You mean, I can actually control my embarrassing breakouts with oil?!? All while hydrating my super dry facial areas? I very quickly accepted SK-II\\'s very generous offer. ', u'I was sent a full size bottle of SK-II Facial Treatment Oil. The bottle is 50 ml or 1.6 OZ. It looked rather small to me, because I like to use a lot of facial product, but as I was soon to find out, a little goes a loooooooong way. ', u'The first thing I noticed was the very classy glass bottle packaging. From doing my research, glass bottles are very important when dealing with high quality oils. Plastic can ruin the integrity of the oils. The second thing I noticed was the ingredients label. SK-II is not messing around here folks. This Facial Treatment Oil is packed with wonderful ingredients like Squalane oil, which is very close to the natural sebum that our face produces, Jojoba oil, Avocado oil, and many other skin loving ingredients. I was extremely impressed. I decided to start using the Facial Treatment Oil the following morning. ', u'I love trying new products, so I was excited to try the SK-II Facial Treatment Oil. I washed my face, and dried it well. The instructions explain to shake the oil well. This is very important because the ingredients do separate. I know I mentioned that the bottle seemed small to me, but you only need about 5 drops. This bottle will last a very long time, making it very cost effective! The dispenser makes it extremely easy to dispense one drop at a time, so you don\\'t accidentally spill too much of this precious oil treatment into your hand. ', u'I dispensed 5 drops, and rubbed my palms together. I noticed a very light, pleasant smell. It is so light, that it would not bother anybody who is fragrance sensitive. I smoothed it on, making sure I got my whole face, and continued on with my regular facial routine. I noticed after the first day that my T-zone was a little less oily. I only needed to used powder twice, instead of three to four times. Within a week, I noticed a serious difference. My dry patches weren\\'t dry anymore. My skin started to feel smooth all over. By 6 weeks, I noticed my skin started feeling silky (Yes!!) and dare I say, a little glowy. As of today, my skin is fantastic. It is no longer combination skin. My friends have commented that I\\'m glowing, which is the ultimate compliment, AND.....I no longer have to use powder during the day. I am beyond thrilled! Though the price is slightly steep, the results are nothing short of amazing, and the bottle will last a very long time, making SK-II\\'s Facial Treatment Oil a must have product.

In my opinion the feeling is of skin completely stripped of oils. Kinda extra grippy. I keep my bar of soap in a small plastic baggie and try not to touch it with my hands at all when using. The very first time I used it I almost wanted to get rid of it because of that feeling and the scent isn\\'t too great either.

No drying skin, no peeling, just smooth, clean, oil-free skin. Just be careful not to use it areas where you want to retain any oils like your hair (I have got some on the ends of my hair when washing the upper part of my back and it REALLY dried the tips) or like I said already, your hands.

I\\'ve been applying this serum in the morning and in the evening and after a week I noticed my skin looked brighter and not as dull as before. I also want to mention another thing that I liked about this product which is the pump. I really like the pump it has because you have great control over how much product you want out unlike other pumps that just squirt out the same amount every time or make it very difficult to pump just a little out. This is a good product but I can\\'t say its Amazing, I feel like there are more moisturizers/serums that will hydrate dry skin better.
