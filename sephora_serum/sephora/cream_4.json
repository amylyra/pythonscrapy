I didn\\'t immediately think it had to do with this since I was changing up some other products I was using. However as soon as I went back to using this twice daily after cleansing and toning and before moisturizing, I noticed within a day or so that my super soft skin was back, and realized that this bottle was actually making a huge difference in how moisturized and soft and nice it felt. I have combo skin, some acne but also occasional dry spots so it\\'s always a tricky balance with my skincare but this adds no oil or anything but really makes my skin feel more moisturized and honestly just so soft like my skin has never been. It\\'s a bit pricey but it actually does a lot and lasts quite a while and for me it\\'s worth it for beautiful skin.

I\\'m so glad I did!', u'I learned that adding high quality oils to your face, not only hydrates the dry skin areas, but it also controls the natural production of sebum (the nasty, natural oil that your face produces) by tricking your face into thinking it has already produced the sebum that the skin needs. The difference is, adding oil to your face actually PREVENTS your face from producing too much sebum. This was mind blowing to me!!

', u'The first thing I noticed was the very classy glass bottle packaging. From doing my research, glass bottles are very important when dealing with high quality oils. Plastic can ruin the integrity of the oils. The second thing I noticed was the ingredients label. SK-II is not messing around here folks. This Facial Treatment Oil is packed with wonderful ingredients like Squalane oil, which is very close to the natural sebum that our face produces, Jojoba oil, Avocado oil, and many other skin loving ingredients. I was extremely impressed. I decided to start using the Facial Treatment Oil the following morning. ', u'I love trying new products, so I was excited to try the SK-II Facial Treatment Oil. I washed my face, and dried it well. The instructions explain to shake the oil well. This is very important because the ingredients do separate. I know I mentioned that the bottle seemed small to me, but you only need about 5 drops. This bottle will last a very long time, making it very cost effective! The dispenser makes it extremely easy to dispense one drop at a time, so you don\\'t accidentally spill too much of this precious oil treatment into your hand.

I smoothed it on, making sure I got my whole face, and continued on with my regular facial routine. I noticed after the first day that my T-zone was a little less oily. I only needed to used powder twice, instead of three to four times. Within a week, I noticed a serious difference. My dry patches weren\\'t dry anymore. My skin started to feel smooth all over. By 6 weeks, I noticed my skin started feeling silky (Yes!!) and dare I say, a little glowy. As of today, my skin is fantastic. It is no longer combination skin. My friends have commented that I\\'m glowing, which is the ultimate compliment, AND.....I no longer have to use powder during the day. I am beyond thrilled!
