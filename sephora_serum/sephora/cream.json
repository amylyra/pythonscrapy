As I\\'m a sucker for face oils, I figured one that promised a radiant complexion and smelled like pomegranates was worth a try. And I wasn\\'t disappointed. This oil has become my staple winter skin care product - it\\'s a very light-weight oil that provides enough hydration without making my face look greasy, and it sinks into the skin rather quickly. I\\'ll use it as a nightly skin treatment under moisturizer and underneath my makeup during the day, as it provides enough hydration and gives my skin a radiant glow. I can\\'t get enough of this product. Though the price tag is relatively steep for a 1 ounce bottle, I truly feel that this is worth it. I\\'ve been using it steady for two months now and I\\'ll wake up with clearer, brighter skin after use. I also haven\\'t noticed any skin issues resulting from this - my skin has been quite clear since I started using this oil in conjunction with the 2-Step Treatment Mask from the same Nutritious line (unfortunately, it\\'s not available at Sephora).', u'Now, I\\'ve got a relatively normal skin type - a bit dry at times, but not overly oily either. If you\\'ve got particularly oily skin, I\\'d definitely get a sample of this before you invest in it. I know that facial oils can be a bit heavy on those with oilier skin types, so be careful with how much of this you use. Yes, it\\'s a lovely formula, but if you use more than two or three drops I wouldn\\'t be surprised if it clogged your pores. It is an oil, after all.

It starts looking oily to very oily for the 2nd hour (and I have dry skin!). At the 3rd hour of wear, the normal-sized pores on my nose &amp; near my nose looked like huge, greasy disgusting craters. So gross! I honestly have never seen my skin at any time ever look like that. Plus, all the product color was gone in those areas. Tried it another day, and exact same thing happened. Trust me, if you test this in Sephora, you are gonna look so pretty. Do Not be tempted to buy it! Wait three hours. The pretty will be gone. ', u'If for some reason you want to try this anyway, be aware that the lighter of the two colors is ghostly white. The dark color (that looks medium &amp; quite dark tan in the pan) is actually very fair as well. It was the darker color that perfectly matched my fair-to-barely light with warm undertones skin. Also, fyi, the peach tint in the bottom section is for cheeks only (not mulit-use for lips too as stated), and is a very flat, cheap looking, light peach. Not flattering, even on my fair skin. The concealer seemed okay. ', u'Back to the foundation (bb cream-whatever?) I also didn\\'t like that it was hard to tell how much I was using. Applying with the small puff provided &amp; patting it on, it was impossible to tell how much product was being picked up out of the pan and how much I was getting on my skin (I had a very good color match and it melted into my skin). I couldn\\'t tell if I over applied or under. And no way this could be applied with fingers. If it was liquid, I\\'d see, oh, I used a pump\\'s worth, but with this, no clue. I will say the foundation did not settle into my fine lines, which is nice (most do), but then again, I never wore it past 3 hours because it looked so gross that I had to remove it; maybe it would have settled into my lines if worn for a full day. Perhaps you could make this work with a not very moisturized face, a mattifying serum, a top-notch super oil controlling primer, and a loose setting powder -- but doesn\\'t that defeat the whole purpose of this being an easy, on-the-go foundation compact? I mean, if you are carrying a jar of setting powder, and a big fluffy brush, then why would you need this? If you had access/time for primer, setting powder, etc., well then you\\'d have access/time for an actual bottle of real foundation that wears well &amp; looks good all day, not a cutesy compact from Korea on which the company spent more time designing packaging than thinking through the makeup itself! Personally, I bought this for touch ups, but it works terribly for that, not playing nice with other products under it, and adding a weird greasy sheen to my skin. Again, after one hour, not only disappearing, but breaking down the bb-cream and Kat Lock it Powder Foundation that was under it, plus making my pores look huge. Maybe they should rebrand this as a makeup remover. ', u'Note: I have worn &amp; liked/loved BB creams, liquid foundations, powder foundations, and mineral foundations, from sheer to medium coverage, so it is not the formula nor fact it is in a compact that bothers me. I just can\\'t conceive of a situation where I would be happy with my face looking good for only, and EXACTLY one, hour.

I was extremely impressed. I decided to start using the Facial Treatment Oil the following morning. ', u'I love trying new products, so I was excited to try the SK-II Facial Treatment Oil. I washed my face, and dried it well. The instructions explain to shake the oil well. This is very important because the ingredients do separate.

I would recommend using this essence with other skii products for better results, such as the clear lotion and cleanser. Some people confuse it with the toner since the texture of this product is so light. But it is not a toner. And I don\\'t think it improve firmness either. If you are looking for a product to reduce fine lines and lift sagging skin, skii has other products that are dedicated to anti-aging. It is expensive but worths it in a long run.

I tried tons of samples (perricone MD, Fresh, Belif, L\\'Occitane etc) and some worked but this one worked the best. Since there is are no silicones there is no immediate smoothing of the skin. My skin did not look very different immediately after washing and putting it on in the morning (I use a very gentle face wash so my skin is not shiny[over dried] or flaky after washing). It felt very comforted; I could move my mouth around without my cheeks feeling tight. My skin does not have large pores, but some moisturizers will clog my pores (like L\\'Occitane); I did not experience any pore clogging with this moisturizer. When I looked in the mirror after work at 3pm, I was very pleased with the glow and balance my skin has (I do not wear foundation).', u'I warm up maybe half a pea size size in my fingers then pat it on my face.'], 'author': u'cambodian ', 'date': [u'2016-11-05'], 'location': u'Bothell, WA', 'skin_type_link': u'Normal', 'rating_score': u'5', 'age_link': u'25-34'}", "{'title': u'Good', 'text': [u'I like this moisturizer a lot!

I received a decently sized sample, when I received a clutch full of samples, a few months ago. I wanted something that was moisturizing, light, and gave a very sheer tint. I wanted it to be enough to make my skin look healthy, radiant, and even out my skin tone. I had a couple of breakouts, and I had old marks fading. This was amazing! I tried it for the first time, and I didn\\'t have any issues, until I woke up the next morning. I had a few more breakouts, and I thought it was because I was trying too many new products at one time; so, I stopped trying new things. I went back to my regular skincare routine, and my skin was clearing up, again. I tried to use the VitaZing again, and it broke me out. I tested this out several times, just to make sure that it was this product. Every time I stopped using it and gave my skin a break, then my skin would begin to heal and wouldn\\'t breakout anymore. I took off one star for that reason alone. Everyone loves the Origins charcoal mask as well, and the same thing happened. It helped me the first time I tried it, but the second, third, and fourth time I tried it, it broke me out. I am going to hold onto this sample though. I didn\\'t break out the first time that I used this product, and I am wondering if if may have anything to do with clogging my pores because of the hot and humid weather. If that is the case, then I will give this another chance, when it is into mid fall and winter. My skin changes from combo/oily to combo/normal. By this I mean, my skin is still combo because my T-zone can still become a bit oily, and I can have one small dry patch or so, but overall, my skin is normal. I no longer breakout, and it may work better then. I gave the mask away though. I love the Boscia Charcoal Pore Pudding mask! Anyways, I hope that this works better during the cold weather. I remember the first time I tried this, I stayed indoors, where there was AC, and it was cool inside. The other times, I was sweating badly. That is also why I deducted a star. This product will transfer, so you have to be careful. The Sephora cast member told me that this product actually broke her out, and she said that Est\\xe9e Lauder has a product that is similar, but it did the same thing.

During the peak of the winter, my skin actually becomes so dry that it peels and hurts, and I was once again getting stressed over the fact that I was going to have to experience all of that all over again. So I made it a mission to up my skincare routine when I stumbled upon this product. Now I must preface this by stating that I have tried other face oils in the past and they have always felt heavy and have always broken me out in either little white bumps or pimples. Nonetheless, I had to make the choice of whether I was going to take the chance of breaking out or experience a cracking face in the upcoming winter months, so I obviously went with the former. Now, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I\\u2019m going to admit that I was a little shocked to see how small the bottle is, but then again, how much face oil are you really going to be using at a time. Fortunately enough, this product hydrates the fact with just a tiny bit. I used about a dime size all around the face. I was immediately surprised by how supple my skin felt after applying this product, and I mean literally IMMEDIATELY after. I know this sounds like I\\u2019m exaggerating, but please take my word. I have used all types of hydrating lotions, creams, masks, and none of these products had done anything for my skin. It does not feel oily or heavy on the skin, and sinks in relatively quickly. It makes the skin feel moisturized and even after touching the face upon application, it feels hydrated and plump instead of being able to feel the oil on the skin. I went to bed hoping that this wouldn\\u2019t break me out, and needless to say, I was once again amazed by how this product worked overnight. My skin felt extremely soft in the morning. Now usually when I wake up, my skin feels tight and dry, but my skin felt so soft and hydrated. It seems like it amps up the skincare products that I use afterwards. However, the trust test was upon makeup application. My foundation applied beautifully! No patchiness or dryness. My skin is actually glowing.

Excess goes on the backs of my horridly aged hands and they are coming back to life. I swear you could drop this stuff on an Egyptian mummy and it would spring back to life! My neck is even regaining tone, MUCH less sagging. I literally can\\'t believe it. I only use Good Genes at night and always, always, always wear a good sunscreen. Holy Grail stuff I will ALWAYS buy and use as long as I can afford it. BTW, yes it is expensive, but you actually get quite a bit and a little goes a long way.
