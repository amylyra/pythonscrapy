As I\\'m a sucker for face oils, I figured one that promised a radiant complexion and smelled like pomegranates was worth a try. And I wasn\\'t disappointed. This oil has become my staple winter skin care product - it\\'s a very light-weight oil that provides enough hydration without making my face look greasy, and it sinks into the skin rather quickly. I\\'ll use it as a nightly skin treatment under moisturizer and underneath my makeup during the day, as it provides enough hydration and gives my skin a radiant glow. I can\\'t get enough of this product. Though the price tag is relatively steep for a 1 ounce bottle, I truly feel that this is worth it. I\\'ve been using it steady for two months now and I\\'ll wake up with clearer, brighter skin after use. I also haven\\'t noticed any skin issues resulting from this - my skin has been quite clear since I started using this oil in conjunction with the 2-Step Treatment Mask from the same Nutritious line (unfortunately, it\\'s not available at Sephora).', u'Now, I\\'ve got a relatively normal skin type - a bit dry at times, but not overly oily either. If you\\'ve got particularly oily skin, I\\'d definitely get a sample of this before you invest in it. I know that facial oils can be a bit heavy on those with oilier skin types, so be careful with how much of this you use. Yes, it\\'s a lovely formula, but if you use more than two or three drops I wouldn\\'t be surprised if it clogged your pores. It is an oil, after all. Also, keep in mind that this does have fragrance in it. It smells divine, of course, but if fragrance irritates your skin, I\\'d suggest giving it a good trial before you commit to it. Fortunately, my skin doesn\\'t react to fragrance, so I haven\\'t had any issues.', u'All in all, this is a wonderful, light-weight oil that definitely gives your skin a much needed pick-me-up while you sleep. It can also double as a makeup base to give you a bit of hydration and radiance underneath your foundation. I truly love this oil; it\\'s one of the better ones I\\'ve tried.

It starts looking oily to very oily for the 2nd hour (and I have dry skin!). At the 3rd hour of wear, the normal-sized pores on my nose &amp; near my nose looked like huge, greasy disgusting craters. So gross! I honestly have never seen my skin at any time ever look like that. Plus, all the product color was gone in those areas. Tried it another day, and exact same thing happened. Trust me, if you test this in Sephora, you are gonna look so pretty. Do Not be tempted to buy it! Wait three hours. The pretty will be gone. ', u'If for some reason you want to try this anyway, be aware that the lighter of the two colors is ghostly white. The dark color (that looks medium &amp; quite dark tan in the pan) is actually very fair as well. It was the darker color that perfectly matched my fair-to-barely light with warm undertones skin. Also, fyi, the peach tint in the bottom section is for cheeks only (not mulit-use for lips too as stated), and is a very flat, cheap looking, light peach. Not flattering, even on my fair skin. The concealer seemed okay. ', u'Back to the foundation (bb cream-whatever?) I also didn\\'t like that it was hard to tell how much I was using. Applying with the small puff provided &amp; patting it on, it was impossible to tell how much product was being picked up out of the pan and how much I was getting on my skin (I had a very good color match and it melted into my skin). I couldn\\'t tell if I over applied or under. And no way this could be applied with fingers. If it was liquid, I\\'d see, oh, I used a pump\\'s worth, but with this, no clue. I will say the foundation did not settle into my fine lines, which is nice (most do), but then again, I never wore it past 3 hours because it looked so gross that I had to remove it; maybe it would have settled into my lines if worn for a full day. Perhaps you could make this work with a not very moisturized face, a mattifying serum, a top-notch super oil controlling primer, and a loose setting powder -- but doesn\\'t that defeat the whole purpose of this being an easy, on-the-go foundation compact? I mean, if you are carrying a jar of setting powder, and a big fluffy brush, then why would you need this? If you had access/time for primer, setting powder, etc., well then you\\'d have access/time for an actual bottle of real foundation that wears well &amp; looks good all day, not a cutesy compact from Korea on which the company spent more time designing packaging than thinking through the makeup itself! Personally, I bought this for touch ups, but it works terribly for that, not playing nice with other products under it, and adding a weird greasy sheen to my skin. Again, after one hour, not only disappearing, but breaking down the bb-cream and Kat Lock it Powder Foundation that was under it, plus making my pores look huge. Maybe they should rebrand this as a makeup remover. ', u'Note: I have worn &amp; liked/loved BB creams, liquid foundations, powder foundations, and mineral foundations, from sheer to medium coverage, so it is not the formula nor fact it is in a compact that bothers me. I just can\\'t conceive of a situation where I would be happy with my face looking good for only, and EXACTLY one, hour.
