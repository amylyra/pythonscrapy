In my teens I suffered from outbreaks of acne. Sometimes my face looked so beaten up I refused to go to school. I contemplated taking Acutane, but the side effects were too risky. Then in my 20s my skin became more sensitive, less acne filled, but still breakout prone. I was diagnosed as having Hyper Sensitive skin. Everything set it off. From the shampoo I used to my laundry detergent. Now looking back I can attribute some of the symptoms (like the acne and breakouts) as pro inflammatory responses to what I was and was not eating. In my mid 30s, I literally stumbled upon Perricone MD. I know this company has been around since the 1990s and I always assumed it was a brand for much older skin. I decided to do some research. I was at the end of my rope, having tried numerous (failed) skincare brands. After reading The Perricone Promise I learned about the anti inflammatory lifestyle and the 3 Tiered Approach to better health and skin. I started slowly. A cleanser (Nutritive) and moisturizer (Face Finishing) were my initial purchases. My skins response surprised me. My skin began to clear and became luminous. Then I tried Cold Plasma and I was hooked. This product is a powerhouse of treatments. Not only did the Cold Plasma rid my skin of its redness, but it started to transform it. My skin became smoother in texture but tougher against the elements. Less sensitive, even more luminous. My pores appearance began to shrink! Cold Plasma became the armor that protected my face from the elements. My experience with the Perricone products has exceeded my expectations. Not only did I gain CLEAR and glowing skin, but I am healthier and happier than Ive been in a very long time. So if youre like I was a few years ago, give Perricone MD a try.

Looking for a product to soften &amp; emulsify these comedones, I purchased a drugstore brand cleansing cream. You know the one, your grandma used it. A week &amp; a half later, my face &amp; neck (grandma said don't forget your neck) exploded with angry red pimples. The random pimple doesn't really bother me, but this was unbelievable. Painful, Embarrassing. More than 50...So, Sothys. Within 2 or 3 days, the tight, painful sensation was subsiding. After 3 or 4 weeks no more raised bumps. After 2 months no more residual red spots. Now for the kicker. No more comedones. I've never been without them. Since, like, the 5th grade or something. My skin is so soft, even-toned, and smooooth. Even when I turn my face from side to side, no bumps anywhere.Here's my regimen. May sound like a whip, but it has worked:1. Two pumps of cream cleanser on dry face &amp; neck before I step into shower. Wet hands, rub, &amp; repeat until gone.2. Desquacrem. It's really creamy, so just a pea-sized bit spreads easily over face &amp; neck. Leave it on while you shampoo, condition, &amp; scrub your body. Then wet hands, rub, &amp; repeat until gone.3. Gel cleanser (just in case conditioner got on my face).4.

When I got peel, the first thing I did was work the pump so that I could smell the product. It smells deliciously like pumpkin! Absolutely wonderful scent! The first time that I tried it, I didn't feel that I got all that much from it, but I know now that it's because my face was not clean. The second time I used the peel, it was after I had throughly washed and exfoliated my face; I felt it working then! I kept to that pattern for 3 days, and I noticed a drastic reduction in my acne, as well as acne scars fading. Recently, I tried this directly after taking a bath, and the results were more dramatic. My skin is so bright, the tone is becoming more and more even, the scars are fading, the small wrinkles I saw are disappearing, my adult acne is going away...it's amazing the transformation that my skin has undergone in the week that I've been using this product. I do want to mention that I use this product every day; I wash my face twice a day (exfoliate both times), exfoliating both times, but I only use the peel during my night wash. That most likely contributes to the results that I'm having. In addition, I leave the peel on for a couple hours (I'm a night owl) and then wipe off, moisturize, and go to bed. I don't advise doing that if you're not very familiar with your skin and how it will react. my skin is getting better due to my regimen, but I would not suggest others follow it unless they are sure it will actually work for them. I would also like to state that I've always exfoliated, but the results that I've seen did not occur until after I started using this peel.

BP, Salicylic acid and sulfur products were really irritating my skin, I was getting rashes on top of acne to boot so I did some research and found this mandelic/malic acid combo that a lot of people seemed to have good results with and it was the one thing I\\'ve never tried!I am sooo glad I tried this! I use the 12% serum at night and I was expecting it to be much stickier due to all the other reviews but it is not really that sticky to me, just slightly, as I spread a thin layer. I use the M2 moisturizer with this as well and my skin is seriously evening out and my acne is fading with each use, even those deep chin cysts, ugh. I woke up the first day after using this and my face definitely looked better! It is still bringing some of the stuff in my pores out but I think that\\'s to be expected with initial use. My weird facial redness is gone, and my noticeable \"raccoon\" eye situation due to BC related melasma are looking good too! Another benefit is that my super oil-slick skin is getting less oily throughout the day and I didn\\'t think anything could do that for me.

I will also always use this after anything rom chemical peels to microdermabrasion/IPL Photofacials....basically anything that stresses the skin. I'm a product junky and use only the best of everything, this is the best cleanser on the market. It's extremely soothing and I'm convinced that much of premature facial aging is due to harsh cleansers. Now If I'm not wearing mineral makeup, or have a ton of eye makeup on, I use Boscia's 'makeup breakup' first THEN follow up with this. Either way, I'll likely keep this in my cabinet and use it 90% of the time until a better product comes along. I follow with Perricone MD's toner thenSkinMedica's TNS Essential serum(all in one miracleproduct) then Elta MD's moisturizer/SPF 46 combo during the day. Once a week I alternate and use a vitamin C serum (25%) also. At night I use this cleanser, same toner, same serum and then SkinCeuticals Retinol refining night cream then TNS dermal repair moisturizer. One helluva routine. I also use an eye cream both am and pm: Peter Thomas Roth. I alternate between several of his eye creams...best on the market.It's a must to use the cleanser, essential serum, spf during the day and retinol at night. You don't have to use anything else but the toner does seem to help these expensive products soak in. I wait at least 2 minutes after each step (except cleansing) to let products work before applying another. My skin is flawless now, used to have terribly textured/acne/oily/large pores/discoloration...Basically I had the worst skin possible and now I'm almost 30 and people think I'm to young to drink! Huge turnaround...I stay out of the sun and get spray tans too.BTW if you want to save a ton of money go for Roc's Retinol creams/serums...some of them include a moisturizer and spf, if you want to use it during the day...either way they are so cheap and have some of the most concentrated over the counter retinol creams out. Remember the higher the retinol, the greater the reaction if your skin is sensitive. Start out low, don't use every night unless you stay with .5% or lower concentration.

If you have more pink undertones, green isn't really going to work. If you have the olive complexion and green undertones, this is going to work fabulously! Don't let the green scare you.

It's a primer, so just like painting your house, you don't just consider the primer as a finished result.Does it firm? Well, I certainly think it's provided a flawless canvas for my makeup and looks smooth and vibrant versus drying.Okay, so the whole vampire thing? Well, I use many different Pur foundations throughout the year because obviously my skin color changes from sun. So, the downside to this particular color of primer is that it made even my Golden Medium look much lighter.

But while AlphaDerma CE\u2019s integrated approach to fighting wrinkles and rejuvenating skin reigns supreme, there is a new way to enhance its benefits by incorporating a stronger spot wrinkle treatment into your skin care system.", "As the understanding of the wrinkle formation process continues to advance so does our ability to impede this process. Wrinkles and their formation due to facial expressions, repetitive motions, environmental damage, and natural aging are no longer considered uncorrectable. Wrinkles have been proven to be preventable and reversible.", "DermaExcel 7 is the first anti-wrinkle product to combine the three latest cutting-edge peptides in a single spot wrinkle treatment. DermaExcel 7 contains 5% PentaPeptide (Leuphasyl), 10% Acetyl HexaPeptide (Argireline), and 10% HeptaPeptide (Snap-7), a Janson Beckett first. Each peptide interrupts the wrinkle producing SNARE complex differently but produces similar and collaborative results \u2013 Reduced depth of wrinkles and younger looking skin.", "The PentaPeptide Leuphasyl works outside the pre-synaptic neuron and prior to Argireline or Snap-7. The body carries a slight electrical charge. When the repetitive movements occur, the electrical charge in that part of the body rises.", "helps moderate the release of acetylcholine during the SNARE complex by lowering the skin\u2019s electrical charge in the applied area, making it more difficult for neurons to fire. Since neurons move the muscles by delivering acetylcholine into the muscle cells, Leuphasyl\u2019s ability to moderate the electrical charge being sent to the applied area is crucial in lessening and relaxing muscle contraction. Impairing muscle contraction is what makes the skin look younger and mitigates wrinkles and their formation.", "Acteyl HexaPeptide", "is a popular ingredient in wrinkle cosmetics and was the first peptide to offer effects similar to BOTOX. Argireline works by mimicking a component of the SNARE complex to block the nerve signals and by inhibiting the overproduction of catecholamines. By blocking these neurotransmitters, Argireline reduces the contraction of muscles and reduces wrinkles and prevents wrinkle formation.", "HeptaPeptide", "is a natural amino acid that contains seven amino peptides. Snap-7\u2019s advanced peptide structure is more efficient at stopping vesicle formation and neurotransmitter release than any other amino peptide. Snap-7 is essentially the next level of amino peptide that works faster and reduces deeper wrinkles that the others could not. Snap-7 accomplishes this by binding to existing Snap-25 receptors to block the release of acetylcholine. This prevents neurons from effectively transmitting signals that instruct muscles to contract. When repetitive movements are impaired, the formation of fine lines and wrinkles is reduced or prevented.", "DermaExcel 7\u2019s formula is an evolutionary step in spot wrinkle prevention and repair targeted at eliminating the final deep wrinkles that resist AlphaDerma CE. By combining three cutting-edge peptides, along with Alpha Lipoic Acid, a powerful antioxidant, DMAE, a skin firmer, and Shea Butter, a superior skin moisturizer, Janson Beckett continues a multi-faceted approach to anti-wrinkle and anti-aging skin care.", "Similar to its sibling AlphaDerma CE, DermaExcel 7 can produce results immediately. Test subjects reported seeing quick improvements and commented they felt their skin tighten and pleasantly tingle for up to 30 minutes after application. AlphaDerma CE revolutionized wrinkle creams, and now DermaExcel 7 is ready to safely but aggressively eradicate your last stubborn or hard-to-remove wrinkles.

It reminds me of my old favorite discontinued DDF Organic Sunscreen. It is light weight and easy to blend and very moisturizing. Usually with physical sunscreens my skin gets flaky and dry towards the end of the day but not with this sunscreen. Makeup can be applied over it with no problem. It comes off very easily with regular cleanser and there is no need for makeup remover to get it off.', 'author_name': u'Agave'}"], "review_rating": ["5.00"], "benefit": ["Micronized Titanium Dioxide formula goes on smooth, light and water resistant.", "Titanium Dioxide works immediately to physically block the harmful effects of the sun.", "Broad spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays.", "Oil-free, absorbs quickly, leaves no residue or white streaks.", "Helps prevent heat buildup on skin.", "Non-comedogenic, PABA and fragrance-free.", "Non-irritating, maximum protection formula."], "price": ["$55.00"], "ingredient": ["Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide 2.48%, Zinc Oxide 6.00%Inactive Ingredients: Water (Aqua/Eau), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Methicone, Sodium Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Cetyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-6 Isostearate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Panthenol, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydiemthylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Triethoxysilylethyl Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Hexyl Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Chamomilla Recuti
