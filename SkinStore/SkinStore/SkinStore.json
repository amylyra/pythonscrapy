My skin feels smooth, radiant and it has helped with wrinkles, firming and toning as well.

{"sku": ["11331603"], "regimen": ["3 Minute Peel: This is not a mask. Cleanse skin and leave slightly damp. Spread gel thinly and quickly over your forehead, cheeks, chin, neck, and decollete. Quickly begin massaging these areas in a circular motion with slightly damp hands using light to moderate pressure. After 15-20 seconds, solids should form under the fingertips. This means the peel is activating correctly as the gel is now combining with your dead skin (proteins). Massage for 2-3 minutes or until all of the gel has combined with dead skin. Cleanse area again. To save time, try using the peel in the shower! Just pat your face and hands mostly dry and the use the peel as directed.\u00a0 Upon completion, turn back to the shower head to rinse.\u00a0 The water pressure will also assist with removal of the tiny solids from fine facial hair.3 Minute Peel - Body: In shower, cleanse skin with a mild cleanser. Pat area dry, but leave slightly damp. It is best to peel one area at a time and a small amount goes a long way. For example, squeeze a small amount of gel from the pouch and spread it thinly over one forearm, upper arm, and shoulder. Quickly begin massaging the area in a circular motion with slightly damp hands. You will feel the polishing sand right away. Continue to massage and the gel peel starts to combine with surface proteins and debris after about 15-20 second so at this stage, you will begin to feel tiny, new solids under the fingertips. This means the peel is activating correctly and the gel is now combining with your dead skin (proteins). Massage for 2-3 minutes or until all of the gel has combined with dead skin. The peel will look and feel slightly foamy. The polishing sand assists with complete removal of the tiny solids from the surface of the skin for smooth, hydrated, velvety skin. Cleanse area peeled again and go on to the next area to be peeled. Remember to pat dry each area and hands to remove excess moisture. Slightly damp hands and skin produce the best results. After peeling, apply rich moisturiser.Serum: Cleanse skin with a mild cleanser. Pat dry.\u00a0 Dispense 3-4 drops of Daily Serum onto the fingertips and spread evenly over face, neck, and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. Repeat twice daily prior to adding additional skin care and cosmetics products.\u00a0 Ideally, the serum should be worn on the skin everyday all year around under other products like moisturizer, foundation, and sun block.\u00a0 We strongly advocate the skin protection standards set by the Skin Cancer Foundation and the CDC and recommend using an effective physical sun block every day of the year.Rescue Masks: Tear the mask pouch open across the top. Remove the fabric mask and unfold it until the face-shape is clearly visible. Apply to clean dry skin and press the wrinkles out of the mask so the mask fits snugly to the face. Wear the mask for about 20-30 minutes or until it feels dry and begins to lift. This is an indication that all the serum has been absorbed into the skin. During the process, continually smooth excess serum into the neck and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. Keep the pouch nearby. When the mask is removed, squeeze all the remaining serum out of the pouch and press into the skin to ensure that not one drop of this amazing serum is wasted by being left in the pouch.Cleanser: Dispense a dime-sized amount of cleanser onto fingertips and gently work into a foamy lather. Massage over the face in light circular motions. Gentle enough to use on eye lids and under eyes. Keep out of eyes and avoid ingestion into nose and mouth. Rinse with cool or warm water.

(Stateside most insurance companies will not pay for pure Retinol if you over eighteen, unless it is precertified by your company with a physician\\'s request.) Even then, many insurers will not pay for it as they know women use it for a beauty treatment which may be quite costly out of pocket.I have used topical cremes and gels in the past, some very well known brands. However, they did not smell all that good and were a bit sticky even though they worked well.With SkinCeuticals, it is amazing how they get the creme to have the consistency and strength combined in an easy pump bottle with the texture and fragrance so pleasant.The trick with retinol is to acclimate your skin to it. I suggest using it as the Brand suggests start off slowly, then increase your applications per week. Since I have used Retinol previously I know what my skin may tolerate. I have had not one day of redness, nor burning sensation and after a week I notice a difference with my wrinkles.The trick is to apply the contents very lightly dab it in gently and give it some time to penetrate the sodimeters of the skin. In my experience, I have had friends who applied it to heavily thinking it would work faster, I feel it is just the opposite. The less you apply until your skin adjusts, the less reddening, peeling and harshness your face will have to experience.I have never had those reactions with Retinol as I use it in small amounts and apply common sense along with the treatment.I beleive this a great product as I said for those who may have the ability to bear the ingredients.I go to a renowned Dermatologist in NYC and his Office only sells high end products. SkinCeuticals is among them and more costly than SkinStore.I went to my physician for medical reasons, not beauty treatments so I never thought to purchase the Retinol there. Now, since I have been in NYC with all the pollution, smokers and dust about I am starting to get a bit of wrinkles I did not have before.

Let me tell you that I have done it ALL and have spent more money than you'd care to think of: antibiotics at a young age (never do this), topical retinols (still current), laser, subcision for scarring, Accutane (back before I worked in oncology and realized it was a chemo drug- but it did help my cystic acne back in my late teens- I was part of a study group and NO I still don't recommend it), REAL chemical peels that aren't legal in the states, and lots of microderm. I've also used every product in every price range (I currently only recommend Arcona) and yes, I use the Clairsonic and have gone through 3 of them in several years (I keep dropping them) and have learned that I can't live without that one either. The only thing I haven't done is full-on dermabrasion. Will my skin every look unclogged and clear- NO. Do I still break out? As long as I keep up with my regimen- not so much. But the clogged pores? They're for life. And I've got a few on my checks that are starting to look like craters- so frustrating. What helps? TONS OF EXFOLIATION. Because regardless of what others tell you- that's what the problem with the skin is. Will it totally unclog your pores? Not really, but it will help with extractions and will help pore size from growing and worsening when they re-clog (most of us with this skin type don't remain unclogged long).After telling you all of this, I'll tell you that I have a love/hate relationship with microderm. I love that it adds a little extra exfoliation (and I can take A TON). I've typically asked for the MAX when paying for professional treatment because I can deal with pain (it's not that bad- I just have red skin for two days). But I hate that it doesn't last. And it has to be repeated often to see results and the price adds up quickly. With all of the many things I need to spend money on, I don't WANT to spend money on this service.So my dermatologist actually recommended this. And she knows what she's doing. And so I thought, if SHE says it works, I'll easily drop a couple hundred bucks (price of less than 2 treatments). And guess what? It feels the same (though milder and I could probably use this thing far more than recommended). I am ordering the red tips because I know I can take quite a few passes with these.

Otherwise, the anticipated redness, but when the welt and redness had subsided, improvement was absolutely noticeable. I was so excited I wanted to use it much more often than the recommended one time per week but restrained myself. After 3 treatments, my skin looks better than it has in years, and breakouts are less frequent probably due to a deeper cleaning/getting ride of lingering bacteria. The only thing that kept me from rating this 5 stars is simply that I have nothing to compare it to. One last thing regarding other peoples' comments on the discs only lasting for 3 treatments: I just rub two discs together--they're pumice or sandpaper after all, so they're meant to erode surfaces--then clean thoroughly.

Go VERY easy the first time you use it, I can\\'t emphasize \"EASY\" enough!2. Practice first on some \"tougher\" skin, like your leg or arm. It takes a while to get the knack of using the tool.

However, strangely, with this SSC, I found my skin brighter and redness decreased after the first day of using it. I have good skin, but have some localized redness probably due to some low-level inflammation from past use of irritated products or retinols. Atopalm cream has helped significantly, so I was very surprised to see SSC could calm the persistent redness further! Also, the texture of SSC is not thick nor rich, so I was worried about it drying my skin out - dehydrated skin is my biggest problem.

(Actually, the Clarisonic Mia also rocks-need the one with the sensitive brushhead, but it cleans pores like nobody's business).So, I have a milestone birthday coming up and I mega-splurged and bought this product.I had been using the Mia for about 2 weeks, and it lessened sebaceous hyperplasia, but certainly didn't make it go away.All derms and estheticians will tell you that ONLY a dermatologist can get rid of sebaceous hyperplasia, so this is really, really amazing!The first time, yes the FIRST time, that I used the TNS the sebaceous hyperplasia dissapeared. I was SHOCKED and do NOT think others should use this with the same expectations.(But remember, I had already diminished the hyperplasia with the Mia).Been using for about a week since that time.Already, my skin is noticeably more even, I had a few milia and it is making them go away and it is even helping with wrinkling just under my chin that resulted from Ultherapy (super expensive, super painful medical procedure that did nothing but cause this neck problem).The one thing I do not like about this product is, possibly because it has alcohol in it (fairly high up in ingredient list- why, SkinMedica, why?)I can't use the 1% retinol product that I was using.I do have sensitive skin (and the Mia makes it more sensitive), but I think this would be an issue for most people.I decided that for now I'd rather use this, but I may at some time go to a lower strength retinol and alternate use of it and the TNS.Also, I have oily skin, so it's no problem for me that it's slightly drying (very slightly), but someone with dry skin would definitely have to use a good moisturizer over it.I am only using it once a day because I tried it in the day and it IS kind of sticky. Funny, but don't notice that at night.Overall, I am honestly blown away by what a product that you can purchase on the internet can deliver.One last thing, you can actually get it for like $100 less, but I don't trust that you are getting the real deal (there are reviews to that effect to).

Also it has some natural Blockers of the enzyme that breaks down collagen, which is one benefit Retin-A has had on it's on. So for those of you that cannot tolerate Retin-A or want to use it this all in one serum provides collagen boosters and Blocking agents that reduce the breakdown of collagen.Besides the anti-aging benefits I love how healing the TNS gel is. I am a guy who has to shave his face fairly often. Before TNS it would not matter what moisturizer I put on after shaving I would get red razor bumps the next day and some ingrown hairs soon after. Now I can shave and not get one red bump and have calm glowing skin after shaving.I have only been using this for a week now, but my skin texture and pore size has been improved already. I can't wait to see the longterm benefits of this. Clinical studies typically show it takes 3-6 months to see the collagen boosting and dermal thickening effects of TNS complex alone.

Only a drop is needed to clean your entire face....and a bottle can last up to 3-6 months.   Yes, I have \"tried\" other products but nothing compares to it.  There is no residue like some other products have after using it on your face which further exasperates pores, clogs pores= black heads, and will eventually cause \"heightened\" breakouts.  With a wash cloth not only do you wash off the lather but you can literally see ALL the oil and dead skin cells that have been removed from your face--your face feels fresh, rejuvenated, and soft (without the superficial ingredients of other products to make it seem so).    Having large pores I never considered my skin to be soft but when I use this  within a week my large pores are barely visible and my skin becomes smooth, supple, and soft to the touch. Yeah!

My skin is so smooth and even-toned! I have moderate/severe keratosis pillaris (small bumps) on the back of my arms and on my upper thighs, and this lotion has significantly reduced the bumpiness in these areas. Each time I use it, I see improvement. Other reviewers have commented on the scent, and I can understand these if you dislike the scent of pumpkin, but the scent isn't too sweet or heavy, and all the pumpkin scent evaporates in a few minutes after application, leaving a very light, pleasant spice scent. I asked several people if they could smell pumpkin on my skin, and nobody could. They all noticed the mild spice scent, but they all said it was nice and delicate. They also couldn't smell anything until they put their noses right up to my skin. I am very sensitive to scents, especially fruity, sweet scents, and I had no problem with this lotion. I did notice a slight tingle in a few areas, but it was mild and brief. I am careful to only use this lotion the day after I shave, as it will sting very much on freshly shaved skin. Like all ARCONA products, a little goes a long way. I use this lotion in conjunction with the ARCONA fruit enzyme body scrub, and they seem to work very well together. My skin is softer, more even toned, and all those little bumps are gone. I am continually impressed with the amazing results from all the ARCONA products. I don't use anything else.
