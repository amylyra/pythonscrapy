Found it and decided to look up its purpose and actually use it and I\\'m so happy I did! I own about six lip liners because I don\\'t have issues with bleeding or feathering and I can get a precise application just fine without them, so the concept of this product was perfect for me. Now, I do agree with people that this does not hydrate or even really condition the lips. It does also require a bit of work to apply because of the formula but nothing crazy like people have said. Feels like a drier version of a Chapstick. The reason I love this now is because it serves as the PERFECT lip base for me. I am of a medium/deep skin tone and have issues with MANY lip colors not showing up true to color because of my skin tone or not translating the same way on me as they do on fair to light complexions. This solves that problem perfectly!! Now I can actually use all those lip products and get my money\\'s worth. Also I find that this does in fact make my lip products last A LOT longer and make them wear even better. This has been amazing with my very creamy, almost balmy lipstick formulations but especially for liquid lipsticks!! Im not a big fan of liquid lipsticks in general, but when I wear this primer underneath, my lips don\\'t feel as dried out and the liquid lipsticks lay SOO much better on my lips. It prevents the liquid lip from sinking into my lip lines too much and looking gross and old which has been awesome so I\\'m now able to wear them. This lip primer also helps with the way my liquid lipsticks wear as well. They last even longer without fading and when they do start to go, it\\'s very subtle and they fade very evenly.

It also gives my hair incredible shape and some light hold and my style lasts for several days when I use it. It also has a thickening effect and makes my hair look a lot fuller. It only takes about a dime size dollop for my shoulder length hair, which means this jar will last for months. I warm the product in my hands and scrunch it into my hair.

I often have difficulty finding an eyeliner that doesn\\'t transfer to my eyelid, and this frequently happens with powder and pencil eyeliners.', u'The first time I bought this eyeliner I was impressed. I compare it to Kat Von D\\'s Tattoo eyeliner, but with a shorter, better controlled tip. It was with this eyeliner that I perfected my cat eye/wings. As previous reviewers have mentioned, it did dry out somewhat quickly but I attributed this to using it almost everyday. I also found the tip broke apart/disintegrated after some time, making it harder to be as precise as I wanted. However, as I mentioned, this was after considerable use so I didn\\'t mind too much. I probably would have given it a 4.5/5.', u'Because I liked this liner so much I repurchased. I had a different experience the second time around. Right at the beginning the applicator was much drier and I needed to shake it a lot before it would apply smoothly. Even with shaking, I had some difficulty and it always felt very dry on my eyelid, to the point where it felt tight. I needed to re-draw the line several times to achieve that dark, inky colour. I also find the cat eye/wings extremely difficult as the tip is so dry I need to redraw and it\\'s never as sharp as I would like. I would rate the second purchase a 2.5-3/5 as yes, it dries quickly and lasts all day, but the applicator does not last very long.', u'I\\'m not sure if my second purchase was just a bad or old batch, or if this is what it\\'s normally like.

I have combo skin, some acne but also occasional dry spots so it\\'s always a tricky balance with my skincare but this adds no oil or anything but really makes my skin feel more moisturized and honestly just so soft like my skin has never been.

', u'The application wasn\\'t intuitive for me but was easy once I was shown how. Wipe some of the product off inside the tube, and then work the flat side of the applicator in short strokes from the outside of the brows in so that you muss them up and coat the hairs (you can also start by running a spoolie backwards through your hairs to make them stand up first).

I often have difficulty finding an eyeliner that doesn\\'t transfer to my eyelid, and this frequently happens with powder and pencil eyeliners.', u'The first time I bought this eyeliner I was impressed. I compare it to Kat Von D\\'s Tattoo eyeliner, but with a shorter, better controlled tip. It was with this eyeliner that I perfected my cat eye/wings. As previous reviewers have mentioned, it did dry out somewhat quickly but I attributed this to using it almost everyday. I also found the tip broke apart/disintegrated after some time, making it harder to be as precise as I wanted. However, as I mentioned, this was after considerable use so I didn\\'t mind too much. I probably would have given it a 4.5/5.', u'Because I liked this liner so much I repurchased. I had a different experience the second time around. Right at the beginning the applicator was much drier and I needed to shake it a lot before it would apply smoothly. Even with shaking, I had some difficulty and it always felt very dry on my eyelid, to the point where it felt tight. I needed to re-draw the line several times to achieve that dark, inky colour. I also find the cat eye/wings extremely difficult as the tip is so dry I need to redraw and it\\'s never as sharp as I would like. I would rate the second purchase a 2.5-3/5 as yes, it dries quickly and lasts all day, but the applicator does not last very long.', u'I\\'m not sure if my second purchase was just a bad or old batch, or if this is what it\\'s normally like.

I personally really enjoy this foundation, and only have it 4 stars because I don\\'t need a full coverage look for daily wear. However, if you buy this product there are KEY things you need to be aware of and steps you need to take in order to get the best use out of it, especially if this will be your go-to daily foundation.

However, if you like a full coverage look that mimics the look of your natural skin, or if you\\'re like me and don\\'t like using a ton of products to achieve a flawless face (foundation + concealer + powder, etc.) then give this a try. A Sephora consultant adivised me NOT to use a powder on top, not even to set, but rather use a setting a spray. I agree with her advice - DO NOT use a powder on top of this product, or if you do, do so very sparingly and only on your nose/T-Zone. Putting a powder on top of this foundation will give you that caked-on look we\\'re all trying to avoid. I personally use a beauty blender to blend this product, in SMALL amounts as you really will only need about 1 pump for the whole face. I then set it with the UD setting spray. No issues with cakieness for me and lasts all day! ', u'Because this is a full coverage LONG LASTING makeup, in order to avoid breakouts you absolutely need to be sure you keep up with exfoliating and THOROUGHLY cleanse you skin! I know this is not true for all past reviewers, but I have a feeling some only use their hands and a gentle cleanser to clean their skin. This will not remove this product alone, and therefore will cause breakouts due to clogged pores. To remove this, I use a cleansing water with cotton pads first, then go in with a gentle exfoliating cleanser (I use Kate Somerville\\'s ExfoliKate daily cleanser), with a Clarisonic. I\\'m not saying you need to have these products to use this foundation, but if you\\'re going to go for a full coverage products, especially one that claims to literally last all night, you best be sure to fully remove it before bed! Also be sure to moisturize like crazy - this will prevent dryness and the product settling into fine lines. I don\\'t personally use a primer with this, but a hydrating one may help! ', u'This product DOES oxidize like most reviewers have said. I am typically a light-to medium shade with warm undertones, but in this foundation and after oxidizing the shade that was perfect for me actually had light pink undertones, which never happens for me. Because of this I definitely recommend having a Sephora consultant color match you, or purchase a half shade lighter than you might normally. Other than that, this foundation really does last all day, and with proper steps before and after application I really do get the most flawless and natural-looking airbrushed skin!

I don\\'t know if they had recently changed their formula, BUT when I used BTS this year, it was dry, flaky, and it would get in my eyes and irritate my contacts. It was BAD. So, I went looking for a new mascara with a wetter formula. I saw the sample size of Ciate and read that it had a glossy finish. I LOVE THIS MASCARA. The Starfish wand is EVERYTHING -- it basically coats every lash of yours. If you have long but no-so-thick lashes - Triple Shot will thicken and darken with one coat. The best part about it is that it stays true to the \"glossy finish\". I have never had it flake on me, and it\\'s never irritated my eyes.
